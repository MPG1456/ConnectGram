Final Project for Data Structure course at Isfahan University of Technology

This project is fully functional, however it lacks some important things such as: 
   - reading and writing the data in file(or database)
   - server and client side for real communication
   - gui
   - and many more things that I may have forgotten

I tried to use multiple algorithms and data structure. Some are the best option and some may not suit the time or place complexity.

feel free to clone it and change it in your way.
